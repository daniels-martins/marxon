[assistant]:Here are some tips on how to start a digital web agency:

    Define your niche. What type of websites will you focus on? Will you create websites for businesses, individuals, or both? Once you know your niche, you can start to target the right customers and develop the right marketing strategies.
    Build your team. You'll need a team of talented designers, developers, and marketers to help you create and market your websites. Take the time to find the best people for the job, and make sure they're aligned with your vision for the agency.
    Develop a strong marketing plan. You need to let people know that you exist and that you can help them with their website needs. Create a website, start a blog, and use social media to promote your services.
    Deliver great work. The best way to build a successful digital web agency is to deliver great work. Your clients will be more likely to refer you to their friends and colleagues if they're happy with your work.
    Be patient. Starting a business takes time. Don't expect to be successful overnight. Just focus on providing great service, and the results will come.

WHY YOU NEED A WEBSITE AS A BUSINESS OWNER

SOURCE : https://www.oberlo.com/blog/types-of-websites

Do you own a business? If you do own one, and you don’t already have a business website to promote it, you should create one. As soon as possible.

These types of websites are proving more crucial by the day, as it’s estimated that 70 to 80 percent of consumers look up businesses online before they decide to make a purchase. However, only about 50 percent of businesses actually have a website.

This means you could be losing critical business to your competitors that do have a website.

When business owners create a website, they should make sure that they’re using the same branding elements that they’re already using on other collateral and marketing materials. These include your logo, brand colors, images, and the like.

Ideally, these types of business websites will also include a collection of informational pages describing the business, which goods or services it provides, and the types of customers it serves. This helps to generate business from online sources, as well as to boost the website’s SEO ranking.

As an added bonus, you might even be able to convert your business website into an ecommerce channel where customers can buy your products or services directly through the site.
